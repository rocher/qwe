Basic Installation
==================

It is planned to provide a better installaion method and detailed
instructions. At the moment, simply add directories 'src' and 'ext' to your
`load-path' Emacs variable and load the library `qwe'. This will load all
core functionality, plus `cfg' and `toc' extensions. To quickly see how QWEB
works, load library `qweb' and visit one of the examples provided in direcory
'test'. Enjoy them!
