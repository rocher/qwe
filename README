This is QWE -- QWE's not WEB for Emacs --

QWE is a lightweight markup language aiming to improve software documentation,
presentation and maintenance. As such, it supports document structure elements,
format text, annotations, decorations, references, hyperlinks and image
embedding. QWE can be used with almost *any* programming language. All language
elements reside inside inline comments, those that start with a special
delimiter and use a newline character to indicate the end. Thus, the same
document is both the source code and the documentation, without previous
conversions needed to compile.

QWE is largely extensible, and include some core extensions to manage QWE
documents, table of contents, configuration items and common headers. Also
included is QWEB, a literate programming system implemented on top of QWE.

For more information, please read file 'index.qwe', preferably under Emacs
using `qwe-mode'.
